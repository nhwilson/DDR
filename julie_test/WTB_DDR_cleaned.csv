1,1,63287b18cc252dd79ffb5fbd,im concerned that prisoners who are already treated like less than in society are being taken advantage of even more by the use of their labor for barely any money
2,1,652fef7dd80b934fb2a0e4d6,i find prison labor to be unethical and the entire us justice system to be abusive and exploitative i would not wish to knowingly support this unfortunately i am sure plenty of the products i purchase do make use of this or are otherwise unethical and i am just unaware of this fact it is also increasingly difficult to make all ones purchases ethical 
3,3,6419d4b95f4baa2bca7aa797,i feel concerned about the inmates working in the program they arent being paid the same as others are they treated fairly 
4,3,5cc99b0973d6e70001c2fc87,i dont have any concerns about this
5,1,60843804f390b5d6267ab3e5,i dont like a program such as this seems like modern slavery
6,3,63d7f3f4e50de685d3d5b4fb,none
7,1,612f6a51d47b137e5f17b49c,it doesnt feel right considering how little the prisoners get paid for their labor
8,2,63fbe246ebac23314dda213f,my biggest concern is how much is the company profiting vs what are they paying the laborers what does it cost to the consumer etc 
9,1,63d6003b46ef9e47b2794909,it gives incentive for companies to use this form of cheap labor which isnt fair to the worker 
10,1,5ab56fdff69e940001d8da97,utterly disgusting and exploitative i would not support those companies at all rotten practice 
11,1,5f87a1363997451dd9d7452f,its pretty much slave labor while i understand that theyre prisoners they dont have the opportunity to argue for things like fairer wages or fairer working hours its less about whether the prisoners in question deserve to be overworked or taken advantage of and more about the kind of company that chooses to take advantage of people so they dont have to pay their workers fairly it sounds sleazy
12,3,650e75a7fc16660ec5fca2c6,my main concern would be companies paying judges to find people guilty at a higher rate so the companies could gain more cheap labor my other concern would just be the overall quality of the product 
13,1,5c94fd48c97725001643db15,prison labor is modern day slavery its making a business out of caged people its wrong 
14,3,5e3d9a08d521c3000ea9e415,none
15,2,63d186666d82414915f77f8a,my main concern would be how clean hygienic and well made the products would be
16,3,5ba596467c0ebe0001269842,all i would be concerned about is that the prisoners are being paid fairly and not being treated as slaves
17,1,5e79923fcce2a2554745023d,its not right to force inmates to produce goods that are used by the general public while they get paid obscenely small amounts of money to do so its the same if not worse as child labor
18,2,5aec7e89ae13140001fc0cdf,i would be concerned that i was not getting a quality product as the person putting it together receives less pay than they normally would 
19,3,57e148fe538c8c0001616bf0,i want to know where the money is going if the prison is making some money that helps support the prisoners am ok with that however i think more of the money should go to the prisoners that actually do the work many of them have bills to pay even while incarcerated child support and taking care of their families comes to mind 
20,2,5ab81f7ff69e940001d8efdf,none
21,2,653009c507ada50f3f0965e6,id have some concerns about the people who made the product are they good people and should i be supporting them if so are they being treated fairly there are so many factors that go into this decision
22,1,5ffd392153021d20d0939515,my concern is that a company and the top executives of these companies are getting wealthy off the backs of other peoples labor this is an injustice no one should profit off of other peoples labor who have no freedom of choice in the matter 
23,3,5fcf3f65cab57124cba19638,i would just be concerned with quality if i were these inmates i would not be working my ass off for such a low amount of pay even if i was in prison unless i needed the money but it is horrible that they are being taken advantage of i would just be concerned that quality isnt the greatest because im sure some inmates dont care about the job because they are being forced into doing it
24,3,652ff8a8ddf809474af6449a,none i would imagine this is very well regulated
25,2,5e44c10bc13da2356b85ff60,im concerned that the work that these prisoners are doing is not for any sort of rehabilitation but purely for the profit of the companies that they are working for and for the prisons
26,1,61096d11ef3285894de7db63,i am concerned about the wages that are given to these prisoners it does not seem ethical to underpay these workers for the same amount of work that would be done by someone not in prison i have ethical concerns about supporting these private companies profiting off of prisoners without them being fairly compensated
27,1,5c4ea6cc889752000156dd8e,i think it is wrong to use private prisons as slave labor  i would avoid purchasing if possible  prison should rehabilitate not exploit people like a business  
28,2,6110e48623d76c1abbb54e79,i would be concerned about whether its ethical to purchase products that i know were made with prison labor
29,2,63acd72d84094941de5813e5,this system might encourage keeping more people in prison just for cheap labor
30,2,5e2b4e61a7f804000a55eee7,i am concerned about how the prisoners are being treated and paid  ultimately im probably against this because i dont think that people should be both incarcerated and then forced to make products especially for a profit
31,3,63d80e0449b458dd5f8140be,quality i wouldnt have any worry worry would be if this was to sour their views of said system and forced into stuff they dont enjoy
32,3,652ebe78088d0d6d13575da3,none
33,3,610b7beb934e1bcc172a002a,the only concern i would have is that the products were not taken the proper amount of time to get it right as well as handling things with care and checking your work i would worry that inmates would just want to get the job done at times an hurry through whatever is being made making it either in poor or unsafe condition
34,1,62838b88bc35e0497491f8e4,given that these inmates earn way less than what the work is worth this just further motivates the government and influential people to put more people in prison to essentially get legal slave work and be able to justify it because the inmates benefit from it
35,3,63fe7df97332b44a2999fc7f,none
36,2,5f338121e1ca2a19a97cd433,while i do understand that it would make the cost of labor significantly cheaper especially considering prisoners are also living off of tax dollars it does concern me a little about how it would affect the quality of products i certainly dont think i would purchase food products made through these programs but other products i might if there is some sort of regulation in place to make sure they arent tampered with the likelihood of things being tampered i feel would also depend on the type of prisoners who get these programs people who have minor offenses id be more comfortable with purchasing products from but not those who have commited serious crimes 
37,1,628e196e63bc7ab9e6c6caea,it is a new form of slavery  the people in prison are exploited  it also motivates people to keep the prisons full  i disagree vehemently with using their labor unless they are being paid a fair wage
38,2,636168a962acef1f1f1cc4ce,i feel like the fact that prisoners are not paid a competitive wage compared to employees outside of the prison program means there will be forprofit reasons to increase the rates of incarceration i dont think private companies should be allowed to profit from prisoners 
39,2,5becfeed4f191100013b46db,i am concerned that these prisoners are being treated as though they are slaves to make profit for a company i would not have such concerns if this money went to a charity
40,2,63225dd98b2a68d9be44f266,my concerns would be the cleanliness of the workplace as well as the workers and the quality of the products being made 
41,1,6530343c3937cb40ee7b942f,i consider this a modern form of slavery  prison labor is not being paid local wages and really not being paid even minimum wage  prisons are profiting from unwilling  underpaid labor this creates a system where businesses uneedn prisons because they need cheap labor which creates an underclass which is basically legalized slavery 
42,2,5f4828f4dbc4a22d4c45910a,i do think that individuals should have the opportunity to contribute to society and gain skills to help them return to the workforce following incarceration but i am concerned about how much benefit that the private sector gains from the arrangement and whether it is disproportionate to the benefit to society and the incarcerated workers
43,2,5f483bd8636f062f76e06603,i would feel bad supporting a system that is so horribly flawed and unfair
44,1,63d7df9884f0b6ee095aada3,i believe that prisons would be better if they were paid more for their efforts
45,1,63f5d0e9eb6cadc114ba3c47,well its wrong to be paying less to those a part of the prison labor program simply because theyre in prison labor is labor and they should be compensated for fairly thinking theyre less deserving is wrong if theyre a part of the labor program are they as bad as you say the labor program shouldnt be a form of punishment but a way to assimilate them back into society 
46,2,5ca54993e706a40016359096,i would be helping companys exploit prisoners thats my main concern
47,3,631bc422eec20143118ad66b,none
48,1,5f58fa9f43f1b20c9761ed64,i dont believe in any sort of forced indentured servants which is what these programs tend to do prison get lower than minimum wage and are forced to provide labor for forprofit companies i would feel highly uncomfortable purchasing a product that used prison labor to keep things cheap which unfortunately a lot of made in america products tend to be 
49,1,64f27e2e6d48b99b27a7aa8a,prison labor program is basically slavery most incarcerated workers are african american thus proving that there are still residual affects on america from times when slavery was legal in the states
50,3,5fb30c999e9ad2a16ca0ce84,none
51,1,5f2dcd2ccfe454102f662f95,theis encourages the practice of using cheap prison labor which reinforces the prison industrial complex which in turn affects down trodden communities and keeps people in jail who do not need to be in jail
52,3,62b75ef252b989fe944f68c3,my main concern would be quality control
53,1,5809006b2a296e0001005451,by purchasing these consumer products i am supporting the practice of a private company exploiting a population of people for a fraction of the labor cost if these workers were paid a more comparative wage i would consider it but not under the current circumstances
54,3,5f1c739305289d0b5b229934,well i would be concerned about if the prisoners were paid through the program if not i would not be comfortable buying those products
55,1,591ed2c61c6d600001aafddd,this practice sounds horrible to me like modernday slavery if i found out a product i love used carceral labor i would immediately stop purchasing it i find this to be morally repugnant and the ceos of companies participating in this racket should be ashamed of themselves but i know theyre incapable as theyve already lost their humanity
56,2,6504660ae5c6b1bba1e7dd77,it depends on how much training the prisoners get for making the products also the environment the products are made in and the quality of these products compared to when they are made elsewhere 
57,3,5b0b8252e9270900013ba88f,i worry that the amount going to the prisoners directly and the amount used for their upkeep in the prison is not a fair amount the total from these amounts should be a decent percentage of the amount for employees outside the prison
58,2,63fa5ba42257e4b0bc6f6db2,i would have concerns that the products may be of low quality since the prisoners are paid so little i would think they wouldnt have much motivation to make a quality product
59,3,65009eacfd6f8c6bb8a3c4cc,my concerns are for the prisoners making these products and if it is being done voluntarily and for compensation
60,2,60de6eaecf5d59c0e0670050,im concerned many of these products are essentially produced by slave labor 
61,2,63d16430ec396edab1fe4a32,i would hope they would have inmates who have experience and are thoroughly trained doing the work my biggest concern is the ethics around not paying them fairly for the work
62,2,61645d805d7b358ed3e052a6,i would feel uneased maybe because im not familiar with that idea im not sure what to think theyre somwhat like slaves being exploited but then again its better than nothing i suppose because they want some form of monetary exchange to buy items in prison
63,1,643d563747adde8322d5cbfc,i want to buy products that are produced by free and compensated labor
64,3,64889a71fa7592ae332fa34f,no issues 
65,2,6337875a4d0587706d8f2543,i think the labor used to produce these products is exploitative i would rather the labor come from people in regular society
66,1,607c4ce73743ee10f2b169c7,i feel like prison labor in its current form is unethical if people work regardless of their situation they should be paid their worth
67,2,63653f935faf902ef037e526,that we need to get the consumer sooner

69,1,62b23ec52d823af70d023ca2,i am concerned with the very low wages prisoners are paid for their work this practice seems exploitative
70,2,5efa98dd74af25000cdbbf43,it could be lesser qquaality
71,2,62e0c93d54972f434349eda3,i feel conflicted because although i think it is great that people in prison have the opportunity to work i fear they are being exploited 
72,3,63bc6e03a6ee3b96041c5e7c,none
73,2,5d7eb7bc85e6c900013f92d1,im a little conflicted while i feel if they are doing the same work as others outside prison it seems they should be paid the same however the prisoners have no living expenses in prison maybe the companies hiring the prisoners should reimburse the prisons for the cost of the prisoners care with the money they are saving on labor
74,3,652d345727df655454e3310c,it does seem rather exploitative to pay workers a fraction of what their unincarcerated counterparts make for the same labor
75,3,58a623e90da7f10001de8553,none
76,2,60ff49adb870d28d817836c3,i dont want prison inmates to be exploited i think they should be paid normally and have choices in their employment that being said i have no issue with a prison employee making my items or playing a part in production as long as they are happy and paid
77,3,588908498fd7f00001d735f8,at some point there feels like something icky is going on but im not quite sure  is it unfair for some companies to use this labor as opposed to others  is it ethical to make prisoners work for a forprofit company  im just not sure  i mean i wouldnt have much of a problem with them making prisoners do some kind of work so im not sure how it would be unethical to make them work for a company
78,3,5c292a8d90aa57000162620f,my only concern is that the prisoners have a choice in participating in the labor program as long as everyone is consenting adults i dont see the problem with it 
79,2,63128ac22b053ba47e97feb2,since they are paid so little the quality of product they produce may be poor
80,3,6458939bc77c645ea7979b33,none
81,1,607331e66524baf7ddfaae21,privatized prison labor is akin to modern day slavery in my book  the profit motive is strong and has likely directly led to mass incarceration in america  mass incarceration has disproportionately affected minorities in america the very people who descend from enslaved persons who built this country for free  same model different times
82,1,5c690f6f81d8da000100c78b,its exploitative 
83,2,5588d532fdf99b304ee567b9,i have no issues with the prisoners but i imagine the owners would only provide cheap materials
84,2,5fc107b696c1250962897bcb,i dont have concerns about the products themselves but i believe using prison labor for profit is unethical
85,2,5ee17828636ea955e8eaf6bc,i would be worried about food production in a prison because i feel like some inmates might not respect food safety or be motivated to do a safe job since theyre being paid so little i would also be concerned more generally about the welfare of the workers and if they feel they are being exploited it seems unfair that private companies can contract prisons to make their products at such a low price and pocket all of the profit im sure the private prisons make a handsome sum as well it just makes me uncomfortable like this is almost modern day slavery in some ways

90,1,5d52d9233d8e6b001b0dcd7f,i would be worried about buying these products not because of the quality but because of the labor  i know that prisoners are not paid the same way that regular citizens are  so i would be suspicious of a company that would opt to use prisoners for cheap labor  if the company made sure that the prisoners were paid better so they could start life outside of prison better i would definitely buy products from a company like that
91,2,63f803e51098e70b96b6d1f6,i would be concerned that since these people are paid so little the quality of work may be lacking
92,2,644a53ac09de69785b70ec16,is it fully consensual or are people punished for not participating why is the hourly rate so low 
93,3,5ef1a03726ae307af5d77baf,i think that these forms of using prison labor is essentially modern day slavery  while i dont and would not expect someone in the custody of the department of corrections to get full benefits and minimum wage pay there is no reason they cant receive something more livable  instead of paying 050 an hour which would give a prison 3 or 4 dollars a day to eat off commisarry pay dental bills ect they could pay 23  or even more  minimum wage is often near 15 an hour now a minimum wage even as high as 5 for prisoners could still offer plenty of profit for the prison as well as allow the prisoners a chance to make money to buy foods from commisary and other essentials many go without if they dont have help frm the outside world
94,1,5589a2ddfdf99b7ae47f60ed,its essentially slave labor unethical
95,1,62e073721cd1f5f6cff50910,many prisons are operated similar to a modernday slavery i also do not approve of forprofit companies using prisons to make money through other people who are paid very little to nothing
96,3,6008cb43ebe07457bd621d95,none
97,1,652eb68b7b6d9da6f02b93be,i view underpaid prison labor programs are a form of slavery and so purchasing consumer products made through these programs is an extremely unethical behavior for this not to be slave labor the prisoners would need to be paid the same income as workers outside of the prison system also for this not to be slavery the prisoners would need to have a choice whether or not they make these products
98,2,6400d91626a7ff50dffaadd0,i would be concerned with the labor conditions and how unfair it is to the workers
99,2,60fe47b274576eb477b06e6d,the largest concern would be how well the product is made  seeing as they are in prison and that wont change even if the do a terrible job with whatever they are producing it would give me serious problems  also they are probably being paid terribly and it would make question the morals behind purchasing from people that are incarcerated

103,2,63ea729bf9951e30282eaae6,i would be concerned primarily with quality assurance and how the money being earned is being used by those involved in the prison labor program 
104,2,60de263c69ce74cd6a2d11d8,i think i would be uncomfortable and disappointed to learnrealize a product i was using came from a company tha took advantage of these programs becuase it is basically a form of slave labor in terms of wages toward the people making them those individuals should be paid a more fair and reasonable salary 
105,1,6385152cb1a6f8aeacc53e09,it is basically slave labor sadly so i dont like doing that i really wish that there was a way to know what companies do that 
106,1,63f7a77c747a28d5fbcfede9,i believe that the prison system is used as modernday slavery therefore i wouldnt be inclined to buy from these companies
107,3,63f79db8834f30734d8c9893,"unfair competition when prison labor is used to produce goods it can create unfair competition with other businesses that use paid nonincarcerated workers this can lead to job displacement and wage suppression for lawabiding workers which can be detrimental to communities
rehabilitation vs profit the purpose of prison should ideally be rehabilitation and reintegration into society when prison labor programs prioritize profits over rehabilitation it can undermine the core mission of the criminal justice system"

112,3,5dd71896670d1a6af9f20eee,i am not concerned about the quality of the product but i am concerned that the workers manufacturing the product are not being compensated fairly
113,2,5cd3ff1ac99584000199dd15,i am concerned that the inmates might be wrongfully incarcerated based on the nature of law in modern civilization  thus the labor might be immorally procured  on the other hand i might be concerned that the goods are of poor quality or possibly even sabotaged by vindictive or otherwise malicious criminals
114,1,5589ce75fdf99b18be3203d2,i think this is taking advantage of labor they are barely paying these prisoners but they are still charging a lot for their products meaning their profit margin is huge these companies should be paying employees fair wages to make their products 
115,1,630abefa2e2a5053ffe0636d,prison labor is slave labor i wouldnt buy products made by slave labor just as i wouldnt buy products made by prison labor
116,2,60bd186e1d5e1d11f128f538,i would be concerned that it would not be well made since they are not getting paid enough they may cut corners or not put in their best effort
117,2,63f564152b3caf8fc0a69dcf,i would be concerned like with any company that the people creating the products were in a humane environment i dont necessarily think the private company should be given some huge discount for this if the inmate is doing good work and is a good employee he could be paid money and trade for a more positive experience in prison ie more time in the library or the gym or this persons pay could be deducted from what it is costing the government to house and feed them i dont believe the private company or the prison should be making any sort of extra profit off of this i dont like the idea of forprofit prisons in general
118,2,6078d70bf4ca7cf039229d11,i would like to learn more about what the environment the goods are made in is like i would also like to know if they goods made are of quality and are safe
119,2,6102c2bafd71006cf4fcbd67,the only fear i have from this is an angry worker who wants to harm others because they are free and not him somehow put poison or a weapon to harm the person who has bought the item
120,2,6038754c27f8091c6c888f05,this sort of programming sound an awful lot like slaveryi would rather not buy products made this way but the fact of the matter is that i probably wouldnt know its an insidious constitution much older than me and will probably outlive me given how us politics go id be much happier to buy these things from people who chose to work and were paid a fair wage for their efforts
121,1,60190457f681522087abda5e,purchasing these products would be a form of support and endorsement toward prison labor and the overall prisonjailincarceration systems and carcerality particularly related to raceracism antiblackness and classism and connections to ongoing slavery and colonial systems in racial capitalism purchasing power is form of support

123,1,55ad16c5fdf99b4c8f99417f,this is a pretty disgusting practice its one thing to employ prisoners in tasks that help benefit prison upkeep but making money off their work while paying them nothing is vile it should be at the minimum illegal to pay less than that countrys minimum wage period or the us minimum wage which is pitifully low but still less obscenely ridiculous than 2hr or whatever if that country does not have a law that sets minimum wage
124,2,6266b47e6da251268380b62b,the reason im concerned about it is because i think about the law abiding citizens who need the work to pay bills

130,2,62961c550afbc1e11a77a4f4,i think unfair wages would have me concerned even though they broke the law they shouldnt be paid so little
131,3,652ddf4bc687f2309554b78e,giving prisoners the opportunity to work and learn skills they can use on the outside is a good thing but i believe these workers should be compensated with their state minimum wage
132,2,5a9ac3061eda410001366658,my main concerns center around the pay they receive for the work they put in i think the wages should be competitive even if they are incarcerated at some point it just because indentured servant labor for a forprofit company

134,3,5dcf34f64fee9907fc626f0f,i have heard that some cheese sold in whole foods is made by the prison population it does scare me somewhat because they have access to drugs sometimes and i dont necessarily trust them i would have no problem buying anything elsejust food
135,3,63ef5d25e9b2814388fe79d4,one problem i would have is the products i am buying are made by people in very poor living situations
136,2,63fbb3b3c4ee7cadb697f71e,i would have a concern about how much the prisoners were earning as i wouldnt want a company to benefit from slave labor
137,1,63deaece57a962469662effc,while i support incarceration for crimes in general barring other factors beyond the scope of this survey i do not like the idea of private companies using prison labor to create goods under the current system of paying convicts pennies for work i am aware that the 13th amendment specifically allows slavery and indentured servitude if one has been convicted of a crime but i do not agree that slavery or indentured servitude should be legal at all if one is working one should be paid at least minimum wage in the state that they are incarcerated in many convicts have served their time been released and end up back in a life of crime due to poverty among other factors i wonder that if some of these convicts had been paid minimum wage and built up a small savings while incarcerated they would not fall back into a life of crime after their release because they would be able to support themselves for a little while as they integrate back into society 
138,3,62b1f2bfcec5a48852005c5f,i would buy products made through a prison labor program if they were of a high quality and afforable price 
139,3,63bc6e49ef966f7b73451b41,i do not have any concerns with purchasing consumer products from prison labor progams
140,3,63c068ce0fbe9f6e7790e09d,i think the program helps both the inmates and the outside world but my only concern would be the quality of their work and products i dont know how much training and devotion to quality they would have
141,1,5e52f052fedced045c73cb72,my biggest concern is the exploitation of these incarcerated individuals they are getting paid pennies while these corporations are making record profits off their labor i will never knowingly purchase any item made via prison labor until those inmates are fairly compensated for their work just because they are stripped of their freedom doesnt make it fair to treat them as modern day slaves
142,2,6100949844ff99c54b0e755e,i would just have concerns about whether it was ethical to buy from them knowing the prisoners were not fairly compensated not even making minimum wage for the same amount of work as people on the outside is cruel
143,3,5b4991de56e0140001acb76b,my concern with purchasing consumer products made through a prison labor program is the potential exploitation of incarcerated workers who are often paid significantly less than their nonincarcerated counterparts for the same labor
144,3,6453ca90ab2eed61e421caee,none
145,1,55c43918fdf99b080551e044,i would be concerned about the amount that the prisonbased workers are getting paid since theyre getting paid a fraction of what a normal worker would its essentially slave labor or close to it another concern i have is the quality of these products some inmates may not really care about the products they are making i would worry about things falling apart certain allergens making their way into products etc from experience working with nonprison workers in normal jobs i already know how careless some people can be i have some concern it could be even worse if certain prisonbased workers made these products

147,1,5b81c0bc35c967000197117f,it hardly seems proper to make people work for private companies who make a profit from their labor it amounts to slavery i could understand if they were working to provide resources for people in need but this is clearly not the case so in essence private companies are legally able to exploit people based on their incarceration one might argue that its fair given that theyve broken the law but incarceration should be more about rehabilitation than exploitation i seriously doubt that these workers would be able to place their work on a resume and have that count as realworld work experience

153,3,58404dae32e21e0001f80519,the concern is that the prisoners might know their labor is being used for profit and they dont get compensated well so they might not put in a lot of effort into the work so the quality of the product wouldnt be as good
154,3,5c92aa671ce0cd00128c6c86,i would like the prisoners to be paid a fair wage even if it is lower than what they would make outside of prison 
155,2,56a68bb49ce1c0000df89344,i just feel like the product doesnt feel ethically produced im  not sure if i want to buy something like that
156,3,5dd91a879dac7c8a7a36fecf,i think quality of the product would the be the only concern i would have
157,3,56610c81b018d100126e5da9,the only issue i would have is exploiting prison workers that barely get paid anything to produce these items
158,1,5d2ffd36ad3457001943fc65,the concern i would have is that those consumer products may not be as good as ones produced by regular trained citizens also by buying those products i would be supporting that type of program which i dont completely support

160,1,5844812dc5bc3a0001a4d553,i have strongly against purchasing products that were made through prison labor its slavery prisoners should be compensated at the same rate a nonincarcerated person would be do to the same work equal pay for equal work
161,3,644087beeb531ba7b10ae320,i would not have any concerns purchasing consumer products made through prison labor programs  i believe it is important for prisoners to learn a productive skill while incarcerated  however i would be concerned if prisoners were handling any kind of personal data  
162,2,631615e2e62254d0d63d1ab0,i have concerns about purchasing products through prison labor programs because i am unsure if the prisoners get a choice in participating at these jobs in the first place if they are forced to do these programs i would not be interested at all

170,3,5de7c6d448241d73d36ceaef,my thoughts on whether to buy products made through prison labor programs i must carefully ponder the ethical social and economic implications it is crucial to support organizations and policies that promote fair and humane treatment of incarcerated individuals as this approach tackles ethical concerns on a broader scale
171,1,60ebbdd7a4f2acdb9a9769e5,the exploitation of prisoners as producers of a private companies products raises serious ethical questions it is bad enough that nonincarcerated employees are underpaid for the value they provide and dont share any ownership of the means of production  using prisoners in this way incentivizes imprisonment unfair pay and coercion
172,2,6109adf08a57d831a2415ba9,i would have safety and quality concerns i would worry about unsafe objects being put into products or the products not being of good quality

182,2,5eb52896e034073a7b8aa981,i suppose i would be concerned about the quality of the products if the wages are very low not to mention criminals arent exactly known for their amazing work ethics then the products made could be subpar

187,2,63d44e414c9d435b2cce7c3a,i am concerned the prisoners arent being compensated and its a form of exploited labor who gets the profits from these products
188,2,61078dfe312f2c312c2c6629,my concern is around them getting paid little to none for their labor i also would hope that the labor incarcerated people do in prison could be used on a resume and shown as prior work experience
189,2,5e8d71d34fbc6b13c7cf11ba,i feel like if these prisoners dont have some sort of personal gain from making these products that the companies sell for profit would be problematic they would be using free labor to turn a profit
190,2,6150ea0af545fdfbb4b6e25f,this type of work is very much a sweatshop situation being paid less than the work is worth is not a business model i would trust at the very least convict labor shoul hold real wages in trust till the convict is released they should be able to use a percentage of their wages at the prison store with the bulk being able to fund a real life upon release
191,2,5e160795265c80bf44a4cd83,it is a great idea but i would like to see the potential before i patronise such services i would like to make sure that the program is safe and secure
192,2,610309d6b51e8a9a5da8a6f4,it would feel unethical but we are on a tight budget and if an item i needed was cheaper and made through prison labor i would likely still purchase it

195,2,5be8eb4d40b06b0001372c77,many prisons have terrible working conditions and the pay that they get is just ridiculously low the problem i have with prison labor is it is beneficial for the companies that use such labor to always have an incarcerated workforce

198,3,6450fec9aaeeb9567886560c,i think its a good thing i believe that prison inmates should be given work to do and it should benefit the rest of our society if they can produce things and we can use them then it should happen  after all they are cared for by our tax dollars for food and medical care

201,1,63e6fbbb06dfbbad96f35f76,i think prison labor is slave labor depending on what the job is data entry is fine and light job tasks are fine it really depends on what it is even some light manufacturing is fine but if its absolutely grueling work then it kinda in a way is slave labor it really depends on if the prisoners actually have a choice if they actually want to do the work its one thing but if its mandatory its pretty crappy im not somebody who wants to make excuses for criminals theyre in prison for a reason and deserve to do time but there is also something unsettling about making people do grueling work against their will 
202,3,5bef2622f3567200016ce7e5,the only concern i may have is with it being prison laborers the labor may not be as accurate or perfect as it could be more than likely you are going to get a prisoners that dont care what they are doing i mean after all they are in prison for certain reasons why would they care about someone else

241,3,63d1c10210ce566ce71616e8,"there are several concerns associated with purchasing consumer products made through prison labor programs while these concerns may not apply universally to all such programs they highlight important ethical and practical issues

exploitative wages in many prison labor programs incarcerated individuals are paid significantly lower wages than the minimum wage and sometimes they receive no wages at all this raises ethical concerns about fair compensation and exploitation as inmates have limited or no choice in their employment

unfair competition some argue that prison labor can create unfair competition for businesses outside of the prison system if companies can take advantage of cheap prison labor it may put lawabiding businesses at a disadvantage potentially leading to job losses in the free market"
242,3,6310b7e45cc45870119322f5,one concern would be that they are being paid unfairly for the work they are doing another concern is if they are made to do the work or are overly obligated to do it it sounds a bit like slave labor however on the other hand if it is ethically managed and they receive other benefits in prison or something it could be a good opportunity for them

279,1,5ee00ba7431cdf357dca02ab," concerns about the quality of products made through prison labor programs for example some people worry that products made by incarcerated workers may not be made to the same standards as products made by free workers
exploitation of incarcerated workers prison labor programs are often criticized for paying incarcerated workers very low wages sometimes as low as a few cents per hour this can be seen as a form of exploitation as incarcerated workers have little choice but to accept these low wages in order to have any income
unfair competition with free labor prison labor programs can also be seen as unfair competition with free labor since incarcerated workers are paid so little companies that use prison labor can produce goods at a lower cost than companies that use free labor this can lead to job losses for free workers
lack of worker protections incarcerated workers often do not have the same rights and protections as free workers for example they may not have the right to organize unions or to bargain collectively they may also be subjected to unsafe or unhealthy working conditions
perpetuation of the prison system some people argue that purchasing products made through prison labor programs helps to perpetuate the prison system by providing companies with a cheap source of labor prison labor programs can make prisons more profitable this can lead to more people being incarcerated even for nonviolent offenses
ethical concerns some people simply find it unethical to purchase products made through prison labor they argue that it is wrong to profit from the labor of people who are incarcerated"

we could almost certainly break the cycle of poverty far faster if these same prisoners were treated as full employees with all the rights and responsibilities that entails represented by a responsive union and we know this theres already plenty of data on avoiding recidivism by removing the systems and ways folks end up in poverty the main reason folks turn to crime and yet because capitalism drives our modern prison system not empathy we accept poor labor conditions for our fellow humans most of whom should be in rehabilitation or reform not working in a data center for pennies on the dollar"

378,1,6404132ea192589b51692c4a,concerns i might have with purchasing consumer products that were made through a prison labor program are that the people who are doing it are being unpaid for the labor and they are being forced into doing the labor

380,1,652ee4c19af20c91c9d88a65,i believe that even if the people performing the work are in prison they still deserve to be paid a living wage if they are not when they leave prison i would assume theyre more likely to return to a life of crime if they dont have money to support themselves i would also be concerned about their working conditions  are they working long hours can they take breaks is their working environment comfortable if i found out a company was using prison labor i would be less likely to use their services or purchase their goods it seems like the company would be using this labor as a cost savings option and exploiting these people in prison doing the work
381,1,5aa2ac74873cda00010d4bd2,a concern i have is that a prison shouldnt be about slave labor at all it should be about rehabilitation there is no excuse for how american prisons are ran
382,1,64bdfd7695f5559fff6d6817,a concern that i would have with purchasing consumer products which were made through a prison labor program is that whether or not the inmates worked in unsafe andor abusive work conditions i do not feel comfortable with buying things that made were produced by people that were suffering
383,1,603e370c5ed1c2db2c3bde24,it would encourage them to continue to put people in prison that maybe shouldnt be just for labor purposes
384,3,5cfb5233df7d70001619ca90,if the prisoners are forced to do the work i would not have much concerns about this practice i understand prisoners are not paid adequately if they are paid fairly i would support this practice even more usually working has both monetary and psychological benefits working also might prepare prisoners for outside world when their incarceration is over
385,3,5f1cf0854f5d3b5e7cb74340,i would possibly be worried about any intentional sabotage with the product but i would hope there would be strict oversight and regulations
386,1,60a1e1f4a3707c983a98f185,buying these products is unethical because businesses take advantage of the fact that they barely have to pay prisoners anything its like slave labor
387,1,627f448165ed9095fd43cfd1,i think this may lead to practices that would be considered a slave labor my concern is that the workers are not paid fairly as we know they are not and the system itself may incentivized jails to keep the inmates beyond the original sentence  such as by creating fake disciplinary violations etc

392,3,650eeb9b8f3a3488ccbbedb8,this would probably be more of a specificprison location regarding the labor and whos actually doing it there may be people who are against it if those people are murderers or anything genuinely deemed heinous by the general public i have no concerns regarding this they need money too

"
400,2,5fc1fdd411437431e95276d2,many of these programs amount to slave labor providing a criminally low wage to unwilling workers with the goal of enriching private companies i dont believe in supporting this sort of exploitation however if i were to hear of a company that functioned in a truly humanitarian way i would consider supporting it
401,3,640152774945eb00209175b4,my first concern would the quality of the products made and how long they would last in relation to those made elsewhere secondly while i believe in hard labor for those behind bars its important to know that the prisoners werent being abused i think hard labor is good for them and would help them learn skills and transition to work outside upon release
402,2,5a5e94a7eedc32000142cd08,my only concern would be the working conditions of where and how these products were made i would want them to be made in a good facility
403,2,5c560b6fccb08c0001e134a8,my concerns are the quality if people are forced to work will the quality suffer what kinds of skills does it take to make these items just not sure if it is beneficial for me to buy where does the money go
404,1,65328193809b5163b9a9a8c1,its inhumane and takes advantage of the system that inherently displaces and traumatizes people of color

406,1,5f26aceb7ee6c440933d9fdd, i feel that there may be unfair labor practices and not respect the workers i wouldnt know what kind of rules would be employed amongst the prison labor program it should be fair pay and hours for the workers 
407,1,60bfd6a8478e7cbb5e86ad85,the safety and living standards of incarcerated laborers is of key concern it is equivalent to modern day slavery with no potential of escape this transforms prisons from places of isolation to places of unusual exploitative punishment that serves no possible purpose of reformation
408,1,5f4af15a0add63150e16e55a,i think that prison workers are generally being exploited  its essentially governmentsanctioned wage theft
409,2,5c193ae6341a240001f80503,my concern is that we may be potentially exploiting them depending on the severity of their crime this is unethical
410,1,63cee4f32cc60cd8fef674ba,i would be concerned about the welfare and rights of the prisoners while they work the last page said that the prisoners are paid less but i also worry if they are treated wellup to standard while they produce for the general public 
411,3,614f2de48a5fdf9347f1cd4e,i feel they may be abused by the system and if private corps are paying i would be concerned about where the funds were going and how the prison would be profiting i would also have equations about taxes 
412,1,61005d0503896fe664cf4127,it seems unethical to pay people a low wage just because theyre incarcerated
413,3,5cdf2adac194e800187ad97a,none
414,2,614e457470e2d169284ce1b7,there is a fine line between helping someone become rehabilitated and exploiting underprivileged people for profit my issue has nothing to do with a prisoners involvement in the work but 100 with corporations which are already seeing record profits essentially using slave labor to benefit their bottom line the only way i would likely be okay with it is if they paid them the same wage as someone who is not imprisoned but they garnished their wages and funneled that extra money to the family who was impacted by the crime the prisoner committed 
415,1,63d837ea31c724120707fc22,i would prefer not to purchase consumer products that were made by prisoners in my opinion the prisoners should receive at least minimum wage which does not appear to be the case in prison labor my main concern is it seems very close to forced labor
416,3,5be208dafbb7ba0001e7e5a2,none
417,1,63b6e6ce132abfb18c08fdd0,ethically and morally i am against purchasing such products as it is essentially slave labor
418,2,6010c31eeb191c464a4c134d,i do not think that it is fair that prisoners are expected to labor for subminimum wage at all i feel deep concern about not only using products created by this subminimum wage labor but also from companies not being transparent about where and how these products are manufactured
419,3,616cda4e2f5f884cdd46b2eb, none
420,3,61081f25a115a7d73dfbc0ea,if a prisoner who has a felony has made something i would be worried about the ethics behind it i would also have a lack of trust for the product 
421,2,640cf05d003b6d02e76ce69a,well to be honest it does worry be a little because obviously they are in prison for a reason and im always concerned some disgruntled inmates may do something to the food or make a product faulty but i do agree they need to be given a chance to better their life so its a catch 22
422,2,6310b35d758f80e9cf3f4e41,these jobs seem very exploitive because its one of the only ways prisoners can earn money while incarcerated so that they can buy extra food or toiletries or save money for when they get out and yet theyre paid so little
423,1,6505eb05db9c13dbcfabc967,"i refuse to purchase anything from a system that purposefully underpays if they pay at all any humans regards of the status in society everyone deserves a living wage 

but i guess this is counter to the goals of the industrialized prison complex"
424,2,5ed102ac8cd1b2000cfdd38b,if the labor program is not paying individuals in the program a wage that is equivalent to the national minimum wage i would prefer to avoid any products created by these types of programs it seems to be taking advantage of a vulnerable group in the population as they are no longer allowed to make decisions for themselves while these individuals may have ended up in prison for committing a crime their ability to consent has been compromised
425,3,6060bdd2935a3eb3bdcdb835,i would have a serious concern with inmates having access to data entry or information processing as this was one of the reasons some inmates were incarcerated for or capable of misusing it but i absolutely support and consider that it should be mandatory for inmates to work and pay for their upkeep they should be paid a fraction of what the median pay would be and the rest of the pay should go for their food clothing electricity etc the less public taxes are going for their upkeep the better 
426,1,63e691a2fd3a3389c644c4c7,i have no issue with the quality of product but the unethical practice of profiting off these peoples labor 
427,2,657724b15dc74943ceac83f3,my concerns would be around the economic impacts prison produced goods might have on the free market since other companies would be forced to compete with a production facility that would have marginal labor costs 
428,1,5fb6098d25cdf2228ccd584e,"there should be a difference between a prison sentence and inhumane punishment the justice system is a mess the economy is a mess i think it would be understandable to have low wages if the standard of living in prisons were humane but they arent if 15hr isnt enough for so many people to afford basic necessities like a place to live and warm meals why would a fraction of that be worth the standards of living prison offers
i understand that it is a punishment but i also believe that many incarcerated people are being punished for petty crimes i believe that food should be a right feminine hygiene products should be a right body care and personal hygiene should be a right clean clothes should be a right
its an ethics issue for me"
429,3,651079beb813e3b7bc264673,i think that it is a good idea and they should be working while they in prison
430,2,5eb339ee6290bc124b8549a6,i would wonder if the products are being made to specification being that the inmates are not receiving much of an incentive to do it right  
431,2,5f0b25970238fd416ca91f5e,to be honest i am sure that i have encountered products that were made by prisoners i dont justify this however  it is part of a larger systemic issue based on the 13th amendment which makes slavery illegal with the exception of prisoners essential we live in an economic system where corporate greed drives profit margins unrealistically and so we decide as americans to justify the free labor of incarcerated individuals obviously there are more components to this like the schooltoprison pipeline systemic racism etc that creates systematic challenges within the prison structure
432,3,578d6aa570c76a000124464b,i would be more comfortable buying products where the quality and quality control was evident clothes mechanical objects but i would be hesitant to trust the quality of intangibles like data entry or things requiring high levels of technical skill
433,3,633643465b40568290457617,i would wonder if this type of work is voluntary and what the actual fraction was of how much they are getting paid compared to working outside of prison
434,1,6527fab8c0fb723fe16a01e5,it is literally or close enough to slavery its is explicitly called this in the constitution of the usa if it is not apparent i do not condone slavery for any purpose
435,3,6116754fdcf6e3da227e654f,its the same thing as unpaid labor basically yes they get a small amount but what does it ultimately amount to they probably cant use it and even if they could it would be hard to afford things if they are used as labor they should be paid in full the way any worker is doesnt matter if they are serving time that alone is holding them accountable 
436,2,6479f2a05e037dbc74dc027d,i think the prisoners are being treated unfairly
437,2,657761a22a1df7e3982681c6,it feels a bit like child labor or outsourcing to other countries where you can pay them really cheaply it feels unethical
438,2,6475368fa8d5b3392676349f,i am concerned about whether the products or the food would be safe  what types of procedures are set to make sure that nothing is tampered with in any way  also with data entry how do we know that personal information isnt stolen
439,3,5c11d4c31f6f15000148d741,that food may be dirty or contaminated
440,2,5ef04fa79a475604dcd8c489,it seems as if inmates are being used as captive labor which leads me to have some hesitations about supporting a potentially exploitative practice
441,2,62fdd0e557fbc97b30b32ae3,since the inmates are paid a fraction of their fair value for their labor it seems very exploitative 
442,1,5dd3351decd14c34f6372d0d,im concerned that its the only type of slavery still sanctioned in the united states and i believe that they should be fairly compensated for their work regardless of their debt to society

444,2,61089ac8867ae303ec5acda5,it seems like unpaid or severely underpaid labor however it might give them purpose so i would want to research before buying

447,1,63f7823635eaa68f32130a14,the use of belowmarket labor by private companies is concerning criminals are sentenced to time in prison as a punishment that shouldnt mean their labor is worth less than other individuals personally id prefer if they only did work for the government ie making license plates rather than private companies if they did take on work for private companies it should pay a fair wage as that might help them be better prepared for life after prison
448,2,6048f641440edbbcbc90f6bc,i would not support paying these criminals at all and likely the goods would be poorly made or not to a certain standard
449,2,63d7aa4a4f19508a5401cc2a,prison labor seems a lot like slavery to me if they were being paid equal amount to a nonincarcerated person maybe i would feel differently
450,1,5d1b8b02e24a990019f32501,its exploiting prisoners for the profit of private entities and its a form of slavery
451,3,64ea292478e6214a440badae,i would hope that proper screening and oversight is done  i also think it is fair to pay them the same as a typical worker  their money could be held in an account to assist them when they are released  it could also help them pay restitution to those they harmed if at all
452,1,657c7805a350f2793ef0e2af,i would not want to support companies who are utilizing prison labor which is probably the closest thing that we have to slave labor in progressive countries in the modern day 
453,2,5dea9f92c3aca11bffec8b7e,im concerned about the ethical aspects of purchasing products made through prison labor programs prisoners are paid very little for their work and it feels like theyre being exploited in this way
454,3,63b6f0c524c4735cd7755c27,my concern is that prisoners are paid much less than workers would be paid if they werent incarcerated the company is taking advantage of the fact that the prisoners are incarcerated they should be paid a more fair wage 
455,3,6400df7ae45255e4b745813e,i might be concerned w the quality but if it wasnt for a quality issue i would assume maybe the goods were a little cheaper
456,2,65847ecf0896ca006d2c00b7,i would be concerned that the quality might not be up to par
457,1,60bebaad355aa083fd9b8c60,i am worried that these people are being taken advantage of because they are in prison they are not being paid well and likely have no choice in whether or not they want to provide this labor these people should not be being paid a fraction of what everyone else is just because they have broken the law 
458,3,62b068bbd9bcb120d812de65,the only concern i would have is them being paid unfair wages
459,3,6413aba87406eb7adb732e82,quality maybe but not really even that none for the most part
460,2,5ef62cf4c9f4540e50940cfb,prison worker programs incentivize high incarceration rates because its a steady cheap labor stream if prison populations dropped overnight private companies would lose profits and communities would lose tax revenue this perpetuates harsh sentencing and aggressive policing
461,3,60077b9945629627d08a2c09,well theres always a concern that it doesnt pay them that much but then again they are in jail for a reason and have to make money for food and stuff 
462,3,6291293b4da216ae257c1867,my biggest concern would be the amount of profit that the company and prison would be making off of the item given the reduced labor cost and what was being done with that money
463,1,5a9f5167873cda00010d2827,i believe forced prison labor is essentially modern day slavery what prisoners get paid for their participation is a joke

469,1,592d00d3b885e8000191bc39,i dont think its fair that they get paid a fraction of what someone outside prison would get paid thats not a practice i want to support prison labor is basically indentured servitude which is just barely a step above slavery and i dont agree with it

484,2,610241c4efd0d67f0d483a61,my main concern is the fact that inmates are only paid a small fraction of what a similar job gives in real life furthermore if the labor is forced it makes me uncomfortable with the idea
485,3,60f3320a37b06dff39dd1d8c,i wouldnt expect to have concerns i would expect that such activities would be supervised and inspected for quality control
486,3,6372a4ce725e6bb64a863e72,i bought a pair of jeans that were made in a prison they were called prison blues they wrer great
487,3,6150ad2e7810ffa81684d2cb,i would want to quality to be that of any other product i do not see why it wouldnt be i would worry about sanitary problems if it was the type of product where that is important 
488,3,6110ae823f68e0b9aed28425,i have a few concerns but honestly they are in prison for a reason and they are fortunate to even make a dime
489,2,5eab19e1b72f750cd7413764,"the prisoners may not have had great training leading to problems with final product
the prisoners are not getting paid a fair wage so they may not care about what they make and may not put in much effort leading to problems with the end products"
490,3,60064b65edefe59c53b97f01,my largest concern is that the prison labor is not paid enough many prison work systems severely under pays people 
491,1,5ab7c19e1667e40001d7cd93,it feels like modernday slavery and buying products made through that system profits the owners keeps the incarcerated working for pennies and makes me complicit in the entire system

494,1,6036b797b572bfc7b694e5d2,it seems like an exploitative system a company can spend minimal money on work fees then sell the product for a wider profit margin to consumers it incentives companies to invest in these systems which in turn makes the system look for more ways to add workers into this pool ie arresting and imprisoning more people 
495,2,57363f5214f69e000d7673c4,i would purchase goods made through prison labor only if the goods benefitted the prisoners i do not think it is right for private corporations to use prison labor for their own profits at that point it is just indentured servitude it is immoral for companies to use prisoners for their own financial gain
496,1,61719b6647a50088271d4ec9,i have a lot of concerns about this the purpose of prison should partially be to help people and prepare them for life once they are released just because someone committed a crime doesnt mean they dont still have human rights being paid practically zero wages is an abuse of power by prisons prisoners should either be unable to not work at all or work for the same wages they would received on the outside profiting off of the incarcerated population is incredibly unethical but these forprofit companies get away with it because no one questions it especially since the prison population is out of sight and therefore out of mind for most americans
497,3,5f490d10022f3f2e8f33cc9a,some concerns might be that companies are trying to get things done using cheaper labor and could also cost jobs for people outside the prison system
498,3,60a2abc7d14eb0935100dd31,none
499,2,5ac68ddbe734400001da4729,it seems unethical to have people in prison providing good to the world these are felons that have done god knows what this information should be openly disclosed if it were im sure this would have a massive impact on the sales
500,2,60c948db3f288a3058c67f98,i would be concerned if it was essentially slave labor which it most likely is i know the inmates arent paid much for those things and granted the money goes towards their lives outside as in if a man is in prison and works to still help his family get money but i have a feeling that it just isnt enough prisoners while in prison for their wrong doings are still people and should be treated as such id imagine these types of jobs have longer than 8 hours and not much breaks little pay for what theyre doing etc it just doesnt seem that ethical to me
501,3,5f36a651ae0be208f9bbc158,i have no concerns ive seen enough documentarys about this very subject to know that all products are vigorously inspected before being shipped out 
502,2,59a811311363d90001676ad9,i dont know how i feel about the labor being practically free and then inmates have a difficult time finding jobs outside of prison poverty and crime rates increase together so it seems backwards to keep inmates in poverty
503,3,633f4b5059234858b7f736c5,concerns about quality control should have a good system that oversees the ways in which they work
504,1,63d98dcfa03c130e4599a907,my concern with purchasing such products is that they be low quality or have defects i question the capabilities and motivations of the prison laborers who produced the products and the system that uses such labor in the first place
505,2,610042bd58bb4f6845302491,i would question the quality of the products however more importantly i am concerned about their working conditions they already earn only a fraction of the wages what else are they being withheld from
506,1,6543b879aa5e69032959f4d1,i feel like i would be taking advantage of other human beings by purchasing these items they are already in prison serving their time and i feel that working for a fraction of what they deserve on top of that isnt fair i would feel better about it if their work got them either the whole amount they deserve for their labor or if they got serving time shaved off their sentence in addition to the fraction of money 
507,1,6109e5a0f7755d8fcba8b50c,well if theyre being paid a fraction of the wages a typical worker is paid that could be considered slave labor i dont find this moral or ethical at all similar work is done in factories and offices throughout the country and these people are paid at least minimum wage those who are incarcerated should be paid the same wages as these people are since theyre doing the exact same work 
508,1,5e68175076ef78000c8f91a3,i feel that there is a moral aspect to buying these products though the person who are making the product may have done bad things they are getting paid a fraction of what a person should be paid i would be comfortable with purchasing these products if the workers were paid fairly for the work that they are doing 
509,2,641cc81a8c47b843f77d303e,i am not aware of what has been purchased through that program
510,2,62b33e2a447824fbd0770025,i feel like the 2nd form of prison work is just a modern version of slave labor its not fair that they get paid so little for the amount of work they do they should be compensated fairly because theyre still citizens after all
511,1,5be3237a3193e90001798302,they need to be paid minimum wage
512,1,5a79f14a8fe2dc00010593eb,i would feel as if the prisoners were being exploited by the prisoncompany selling the goods and profiting off of their labor
513,3,5d4732b70829350016ed314d,none
514,2,5fdd80af5312ca44ef4988d1,prison labor feels like a grey area topic to me on one hand its great that prisoners are given the opportunity to work earn money albeit a small amount and gain working skills however due to how little they are paid it almost feels like the end product is made wtih child laborsweat shop labor this gives me conflicting feelings about it all
515,2,63f86dac40b3632a55be8219,it would depend on the product or good i would want more information
516,2,652ff040cfbead1c3e31614f,they are in prison for a reason which makes me hesitant  however many are making an effort to rehabilitate themselves  thus my uncertain in the previous question
517,3,5df7b79c6887bc562a3022c6,just quality concerns however thats only a small concern for me
518,2,63bd8566ccfd7ec9c7d4644d,i do not feel that it is fair for the prison workers to be paid less than what they would on the outside they are the same person in and out of prison so why do they make less in there is also a concern with the security of these jobs i assume that only well behaved inmates would be working on this but if not it could lead to problems with work being done incorrectly on purpose 
519,1,59a49f188d2b1600011b41ba,id be afraid that the workers would not be concerned about the quality of the work
520,2,629a5e68574432c847ac20c8,i worry that it is akin to slave labor they should be paid at least us federal minimum wage for this work just because they are incarcerated does not make them less than human or other us citizens
521,3,63e554b7631c8ec3ce069e32,dont have concern as long as its quality made the products have to be made by someone dont matter if its from prison labor program or workers outside the prison 
522,1,61087689e968fcf3269375c1,my concern would be that it is coming from the prison i would be questioning if anything is coming back contaminated with contraband drugs

529,2,5f97253793335b0a74991119,i would be concerned that the companies are profiting unfairly from this practice i would be concerned that it is unfair to companies that dont use this reduced cost labor
530,2,650c4b13c66716e1de2d75cf,this seems like exploiting people who otherwise dont have a choice its a loophole for big companies to get cheap labor and seems like slavery on the other hand if they are gaining skills i can see it being beneficial but based on them not earning a fair wage it seems wrong
531,2,608b158ded64d231d8b573bf,i would worry about the amount they were paid their work and their living conditions do they have the ability to opt out of the work 
532,2,651d7fc3b995596cfd898e40,none
533,1,5e43bae59184e3242f23bd31,id prefer if the business of prisons was in attending to inmates needs as humans but in a corrective and serious way prisons ought not to be for profit i would rather a citizen who is not a criminal get the proceeds of this work and the inmates look after their own problems which led to their incarceration 
534,1,61006be07e74dd9f144d12f1,its literally slave labor
535,2,617078fb6641a57cb762a401,i wonder if the products of these programs are produced in a good environment
536,3,58a229e74d580c0001e0a766,my only concern is that the items might not have gone through safety inspections 
537,1,62c5d7ddfee807f8fdc81972,i would think that the quality of the products produced would be worse quality
538,2,63d461ae668907ea6006f43f,i dont like supporting products created with slavery but sometimes the alternatives are unviable given the circumstances of the system that we live under

540,2,65240d2fa731788bf890470d,i would want to know what kind of quality controls there was
541,1,654b007b971573e60e72d25c,exploitation of  humans modern day slavery
542,1,6109e236712f82b8272ac810,it is the one form of slavery that is still legal i dont have the best words to describe it but racism is a big part as to why they use this and is apart of the problems with policing and prison systems they cant enslave people the way they could so they incarcerate black people more and pay them pennies for labor even if that wasnt the case i think they should be paid a fair wage regardless 
543,1,5e69ce2076c4680330657fd6,i dont think it is ethical to pay incarcerated people less than minimum wage i do not see how that is different than slavery
544,3,612597436eff2c3e15310f3f,the concerns i have are quality control and materials used most inmates probably arent artisan craftsman leading me to think the products may be built with issues like defects and missing parts
545,1,5f44b9382561d4000a8740e9,i am concerned about the ethics behind the creation of consumer products that were made through a prison labor program specifically the conditions of the working environment as well as the wages from what ive heard before it sounds like mandatory slave labor under the pretext of a prison labor program
546,3,5da812b2e627d7001017ae7d,none
547,3,638e1da5ecf3d22cdf23925b,none
548,1,5ec17a2e02be030625eaff6e,i have many concerns  it is literally slave labor per the 15th amendment its just politicallyacceptable slave labor how in the hells is that restorative or rehabilitative its not just retributive its a sign of larger problems re the prisonindustrial complex a way to legally keep black males producing surplus value that they dont see the benefit of
549,2,5f51287698edeb30a0cf878d,i feel that it should be an opportunity for the incarcerated to gain experience in the work environment and should help them gain full time employment when they get released in the future otherwise the companies are pretty much exploiting them for free labor
550,2,60ea75cf7853c36527784467,i would be worried that the quality will be less compared to goods made in a professional factory
551,3,586325ee2bd3c900018593ea,none
552,1,651abffdad473f8f07e8a2e3,i am concerned that the incarcerated are being used by others for profit 
553,3,5a1b51e59b760100013a85d3,none i think that most prison laborers want to do a good job and are dedicated to changing their ways so they wouldnt jeopardize anything by making something dangerousbad  
554,1,5d5b67ab9ad5a300181398dc,nobody deserves less than minimum wage supporting such companies would be endorsing their practices so i would not knowingly do so
555,2,5c6836d0f00261000113fdb6,i have concerns that the prisoners are being paid a mere fraction of what the labor usually costs the companies income increases ten fold
556,1,63ea5b93d1c6d38e1f57dcfa,i feel that prison labor is akin to slave labor and indeed is even referred to as slave labor in the amendment which banned slavery except through prison labor
557,3,64488a23553ba5078eb6cb9e,i guess there would be two concerns the first is the trust aspect what if a prisoner did something that could harm the consumer and the second woukd be how ethical and fair is if to purchase items knowing the company is using prisoners like slaves basically and making that much more profit because they dont have to pay them as they would a worker on the outside
558,2,657633006a70a5bd8fbc9de8,products made with prison labor might not be ethical as the workers are not paid minimum wage and do not get to choose the job

562,2,65733a17a936e0730e204bf1,i have concerns about purchasing products made through prison labor programs such  as ethical issues surrounding wage disparities and potential exploitationi am also worried about working conditions doubts regarding rehabilitation effectiveness and the lack of transparency in oversight additionally fears of unfair market competition and the stigma associated with such products contribute to public apprehension
563,3,63336fbfcaa4a5d476a28b53,im not really comfortable with prisoners making food items that might be sold to the public but anything else would give me no problems at all in fact i think its a good idea to give prisoners some kind of honest work to do it might even help them find a job if and when they get out of prison
564,1,5d4a6459061e2a000138bad3,"prison labor is slave labor which is unethical on multiple levels the first is simply that the prisoners are not correctly compensated for their work companies are able to make an extra profit off of people they do not pay and who cannot reasonably refuse i do not support that prison labor is also allows companies to get work done without hiring from the general labor pool denying jobs to people not in prison

there is no moral or ethical justification for allowing this and i do not support it prisoners should be paid the same as everyone else or excluded from the labor pool"
565,1,60e8b68c9033e23d58e9dcc0,none
566,2,65626cc8ce1eab7aaec3a55b,may not be well made
567,1,60fcd954f5ff1656599b53c9,my only concern with purchasing consumer products made through prison labor is the underpaying aspect towards the prisoners outside of prison people making these products would be payed substantially more also i feel that the quality isnt regulated as much as it would be on the outside world 
568,2,55a06b7afdf99b26ce7c5582,i dont think its very ethical to pay prisoners so low for doing real work i think its fine to have them do work to support other inmates but it feels a little grey area to have them making stuff to sell to the outside its almost like slave labor
569,3,62a0e45a42fe6bdc52816cba,what kind of standard is applied when the inmates are working

571,2,5eb070eb793af1113c01e244,none
572,3,63cf09b5ff96755df8057199,i think there could potentially be lower quality to these goods since there is less incentive to complete the work correctly 
573,1,5df0932af9a01d0dabd9313d,i would be concerned with the quality of the products the labor is sought out specifically because it is cheaper for the manufacturer which leads me to believe the quality of whatever theyre making is already poor i also think its inhumane to force people to work for less than they deserve just because theyre incarcerated
574,3,5e6560b5b402952e900827c5,none
575,1,62c2f317234b9ce70f6d3578,i think its unethical and slave labor   they should pay them the going rate instead of exploiting cheap pennies on the dollar labor
576,1,6078b85e024d1d094113c3aa,its coerced labor for inhumane pay i dont like the idea that we just get to exploit them because fuck em theyre convicts feels like it results in a more cyclical recidivist system
577,3,5fd23ecda6599f06a53f4f62,none
578,1,5d0fb996286e1700010de2c1,it seems to close to slave labor
579,3,60fcc00af3ec0d2d4b95c4be,this is tough i want to support inmates work and do not want to discriminate when purchasing goods i want those who are incarcerated to spend their time doing something beneficial and productive like work however i do not support how little the inmates are paid i would buy the goods to encourage inmate work but i would hope that over time private companies raise the price of those goods to more fairly compensate inmates
580,1,63cbfaf6ab54f6b8d8a054d7,its slave labor i would feel uncomfortable

582,1,6475208cd6045ed7c2e281ab,i believe it is morally wrong to steal labor from prisoners  or from anyone for that matter incarceration is a prisoners punishment if a business wants to offer labor opportunities to prisoners the prisoners should be paid a fair wage if a business cant afford to make their goods or provide their services by paying workers a living wage they shouldnt be in business
583,1,5cc482bd8d2a1e001885c450,these companies are using basically slave labor to save on costs this takes jobs from people who need them 
584,1,60fc65faaad08e9c5457b082,i would feel like this is akin to slavery or unfair labor them being underpaid isnt fair companies shouldnt benefit from an already screwed incarceration system

588,3,658343a1d729f3d5c25c7f0b,my only concern would be if the prisoners had proper training when fabricating a product  is the product going to be reliable
589,2,60cec5dbf17b09ca3edf5d33,i would be concerned about the exploitation of the prison workforce which could then lead to the inappropriate imprisonment of people to further expand this workforce i would also be concerned about the quality of workmanship of a product which was made by someone who lacks any interest or motivation in creating a quality product
590,2,6400e3697879c55c323f34d0,the main concern i have is if the prisoners are given the same worker protections as a normal employee
591,3,65341e847687a1235b1bee61,i feel that working is a part of rehabilitation and that feeling productive is valuable for the company the individual and the consumer  there is no downside that i can see to having prison laborers working for less money since they are completing their sentence  also if a manufacturer can reduce costs it may make items available for less
592,1,65805ebebd8b8e2730bdc0af,this feels like slave labor monies would be better spent in teaching skills
593,3,5adb8015f6b58c0001fa382f,i would be wondering how fair the wages are for these prisoners
594,1,5ef6388f2b457c0fb2a4384d,i worry that prison workers are being taken advantage of in numerous situations

599,1,6129ba3532102d5c539ff29b,it seems unethical and like slavery although it could also be a good thing as the prisoners could be learning new skills which could help them become more employable when released from prison

605,2,629546e640163d6d469ed3be,i would be concerned that the people making these items were not being given a fair wage or didnt have the same basic rights as other workers 
606,1,5efe29d315ba872fa20a9c3d,because we are supposed to be a civilized and modern country yet we are using prison labor to make products four companies and corporations at a much much lower cost this is very similar to slave labor i guess these people have committed crimes and most of them deserve to be in jail for them but we should not exploit them for labor they still deserve to be treated with dignity
607,2,65675bf1cebf57f45586d9a2,none
608,2,5c144c641f6f1500014950e5,i would be worried that the prisoners are being taken advantage enough and are either not being appropriately compensated for their work or are being overworked due to their circumstances
609,2,63e8326b8d067b28655586fb,none just question the authority of the company

612,3,62e185310b9f424dae8113a9,my main concern revolves around potential exploitation but if the company treats its workers fairly then id have no issue 
613,3,5e2926d80beb030ede110e67,i dont really have any concerns about buying products made my prisoners i think they would be made just as well as by anyone else since im sure they have to pass certain standards to be sold i also think its a good idea to keep prisoners busy and a fraction of the average pay for such a job is fair considering the high cost of housing a prisoner as well as their need to learn a lesson for whatever theyve done and not think of prison as a place of permanant employment just a place to learn skills for the outside world 
614,2,5dd2c24718beb62c404d5099,if prisoners are making products for sale to the general public that should be paid equal wages to what would be paid outside prison some portion of the earnings should go to a victims fund not paying compensation comparable to that paid outside prison is a form of involuntary servitude 
615,2,608f2ebc23ba13416e9a7e57,im honestly not sure id have some reservations if the product was well made and i needed it then i would probably consider it it would really depend 
616,2,59d662aa0c0c7100015b9af6,you dont know how good the quality is considering theyre probably inexperienced at this type of work  also how good is the materials used  last of all its coming from a prison which that itself looks bad
617,1,5b0ef5a630037f0001d0ff4b,i think this is a disgusting practice inmates should be paid as much as a regular emoployee would make i would not want to support goods made in this way
618,2,5a0ef93279f96a0001c73f25,one concern i have is the possibility of those incarcerated for serious violent unforgivable crimes being paid for their work other than that i have no other issues
619,1,5eb468848e9d2a2c081ff09b,because the way they are treated and paid and held constitutes slavery 
620,3,5d89c4dd68f9d60001a21500,the only concern would be labor practices if the prisoners are getting paid or treated well 
621,1,654d3a401d8c1ce5b38925b3,i believe all people should be paid fairly for their labor regardless of incarceration status forprofit prisons are a blight on our society and must be eliminated
622,3,628b8ef9ef5432197c27bbc9,none
623,1,576704bffdff7a0001c12890,as incarcerated workers have few rights under the under the thirteenth amendment i do not believe it is ethical in any way to purchase consume support stock supply or otherwise engage with products or services that utilize incarcerated labor
624,2,5f616d5523e52610f1ac1a16,the people who made the products or participated in the manufacturing of the products are not receiving proper compensation therefore the company ends up making much more money and profits off the misfortune of others 
625,1,631ab79e8635a1df26319958,my concern is that using prison labor is the same as slavery or even sweatshops i would be concerned not only about their working conditions living conditions and how they get paid but also i would be concerned about the initiative given to officers with a for profit prison labor system there is now an initiative for officers to arrest people they are essentially hiring new workers
626,3,6570e0baf4750c58dffb7b6c,none
627,2,5cfd7167adab2f0016d1571f,i dont think id know which ones were made by prisoners so itd be good if products made by prisoners were required to be labeled as such

629,2,5dd0c9af2b033b185c90d5f0,i dont have concerns about the quality of the products being made i would however have concerns purchasing product that i know were made from these private prison as i believe the practice is unethical work done by prisoners to benefit private companies should be voluntary and pay them a reasonable wage
630,2,5f507fb3e29c991f68f5879a,the prisoners are paid less than a fair wage for their work
631,3,62c55056993f53f1e8cf8e30,i would be concerned about the pay for the workers
632,2,63d42d3563ac982cbbfe3300,yes i understand they are prisoners but i would be worried about their conditions at work 
633,2,651daebc9980deec56738663,i dont have a huge concern we dont know anything about other products nor where they comes from or who produced them so i do not have much concern with it being a prisoner who is just doing something to pass time throughout their days
634,1,5be4f33bee923700016d15df,i feel that these programs exploit human beings simply because people have made mistakes and are incarcerated does not give the state the right to use these people as modern slave labor i feel that using these inmates to produce consumer goods in unethical due to government giving a boon to private corporations by providing labor that can be compared to modern slave labor and exploitation additionally the states responsibility should be to its citizens and offering the opportunity and resources for its citizens to rehabilitate their behavior while incarcerated not prioritize giving boons to private corps for economic kickbacks
635,1,5cb62e9293342300017a72a1,i think they are exploiting prisoners by not paying them and basically enslaving them
636,2,558965bffdf99b74158d77dd,prison labor is not motivated by any financial or jobrelated motivators because the work is done by incarcerated individuals for whom the work is mandatory so i would doubt the commitment to quality of anything manufactured in this way
637,3,5fa04f87861aca05fab63ece,none
638,1,61531a9bd8acf4e88e083892,it is a form of slavery 
639,3,6102201d916cbe6d39df3b62,i do not think i would have any concerns about the product made i think it is more about what they are getting paid if they are not paid a decent amount i think it may affect the quality 
640,3,56a68b2d9ce1c0000cf89299,mostly none but maybe i would worry about them being exploited for labor
641,2,5f9b05167e97592c4251373b,id have an issue if it was made properly or if there were anything that prisoners would do to mess with the consumer products 
642,2,6557733b5c53376695c88ad8,i feel that work to support the prison could be considered part of punishment for whatever crime was committed  it seems that it is for the support of the prison and may reduce the cost of prison to the tax system  however in situation 2 it seems that it is closer to slave labor  the prisoners are not compensated well and the benefit does not reduce the burden of the prison to the public  it seems that the only benefit is to corporations and they are taking advantage of the prisoners who dont have any choice about were they work 
643,3,642c4f6e95f13dc4c1b54712,none
644,1,62f557535db76f7f4ab860c7,i personally dont have a problem with these programs  i think the inmates should get workplace skills and other things so as to keep them from continuing these types of behaviors outside  however its the prison system taking advantage of basically slave labor for profit  these prisoners need paid and to be able to accrue this money while doing labor and not just for free to profit others that own the prison system  this is legalized slavery
645,2,5ef0fb1446d50e6bd601c322,since they are imprisoned i am worried they are grossly underpaid this sounds essentially like slave labor if they are going to create for those companies then they should receive minimum wage in their state at a minimum 
646,1,5d1426c8efc9c20001495f2f,i have problems with the prison system and how it disproportionately affects poor people and people of color and i would consider this akin to slave labor i also believe that prison reform should include giving people adequate pay for their jobs while incarcerated
647,3,54283748fdf99b152ef9a368,my concern is that the prisoners are not being paid a fair wage for their labor but they also need the work in order to afford necessities 
648,3,651d9a7ca4aa61b09d39ce1e,i dont really think that this creates a concern for me 
649,3,5d6807f9778de5001a120d9a,the concerns i have is the companies profiting off these prisoners making these products for pennies an hour they are exploiting a system setup and designed to keep modern day slavery in place these outside companies have a vested interest in having as many people imprisoned as possible since the labor for their products are made by these people cheap labor means cheap overhead costs so they can have much more profits
650,2,5f6377b2155684053b55dfcc,the products made through these programs may be of lower quality because of the lower pay the prisoners may be less willing to put in effort while making these products creating lowerquality products
651,2,610f188b8ad0a93f6d508cad,i have doubts these companies would hire violent convicts or inmates who would otherwise pose a threat to society and sabotage any products they made but even though theyre in prison it does seem like a form of exploitation they get paid below minimumwage and i feel thats unfair to them i heard minced garlic is one of the products thats produced by prisoners and the garlic does terrible things to their hands
652,3,5b564fb0162d5d00011039c7,as an advocate for inmate rights i wouldnt be concerned about purchasing their products at all
653,2,63646a72e194364895584f5b,my main concern is that they are not being paid a fair wage for their work
654,2,5e8bfad5b546910e7553a080,while i do think these programs have value in the sense that it gives inmates a chance to learn some skills and kind of ease into the idea of having a job after prison however because they typically arent compensated properly or even remotely properly its almost like supporting slave labor 
655,2,5dc59839e4f0ff41239cb481,it depends if some of the proceeds are going towards the prisoner that is one thing if everything goes towards the prison then i would not want to contribute to that 
656,1,652becadf20dbdfe37b610a9,i avoid purchasing from companies that contract prison labor
657,2,5dd3bfcd8b8df139ce007928,my concerns are that while these programs are helping inmates gain skills i might have ethical concerns about purchasing consumer products made through a prison labor program that appears exploitative if they receive only a fraction of the pay the business concern is making out like bandits i dont want to be party to perpetuating slave labor or at the very least indentured servitude which is prohibited by our laws

660,2,5b26b4ae007d870001c7cd78,it depends what they are and how exactly they are made
661,1,65786ed4594f411b4eb9ed13,despite these workers being incarcerated it is unethical to pay them less than a living wage to perform the same labor as those outside of prison prisoners have families and relatives that depend on them and reincarceration rates are high because many prisoners lack the financial stability or institutional support to make a life outside of the prison system start by paying them a living wage and giving them an opportunity to contribute to society typically i dont want to support sweat shops and unethical labor from overseas how is this any different if it is done on home soil
662,2,632a55ec20348fa9e5caaa3f,creating cheaper products through cheaper labor creates an unfair advantage for companies that engage in these practices it also starts to feel like it infringes on worker rights and setting a fair wage
663,2,60abe580aa82f25a7acc9800,my concern is that a prisoner may have hidden something within the product that goes undetectable but has people on the outside that will be looking for it i dont know if i watch too much ncis and criminal minds or if this really is a thing
664,2,5e63e793e50a6316a75213c4,the concern i would have is that the inmates are being exploited for their labor despite the infractions they have committed it is wrong for companies to take advantage of the labor and then pocket the difference of what it would typically cost i would have severe misgivings about buying products made from prison labor
665,3,652c26666ff7f0bc98b61be8,i would be concerned because its basically slave labor but at the same time if the products are of a cheaper price well inflation is hitting hard i dont support the practice but im not going to avoid it if the products are less expsensive
666,1,62e4948be9a4d0cc718eeeb8,i believe that this type of labor is akin to indentured servitude and is morally bankrupt and indefensible

672,3,62c0e760fe5cc4964a774900,i have no concerns it gets them skilled for the outside world when they leave prison and gives them money to buy things in jail cells like tv time and other goods and services like snacks
673,1,607ba9f40639e8a2c931d622,this is exploitation 
674,2,655f94a8e52c55fdec3da167,it is concerning to me to purchase products that are essentially made with slave labor 
675,1,64151f08bb5879eb3a22d82b,i am extremely against this as it is basically slave labor what option do the laborers have in this while i understand that it is probably nice for them to have something to pass the time while incarcerated they could at least be paid more than what they are paid this is a despicable practice and is also furthering our problem with prisons being overpopulated 
676,2,5e3a821036cd5e28f05fa245,exploitation of prison workers either working for free or very low wages

679,1,5bfc4058bab673000163c8af,i would be concerned with the quality of the products they make because these people arent highly trained to make products and they arent highly motivated to care about the quality of the products they make

686,2,638d3556e70c7bf15705e35b,my decision to purchase products made through a prison labor program would be made after i collect enough information about the ethical aspect of the low wages paid to incarcerated workers or the conditions under which they work
687,1,5fc54af5d4630404ca86fa7e,i dislike the second type of prison labor program its exploitative towards society in general since companies have an excuse to not pay the workers a fair wage and nonincarcerated people who might benefit from decent lowerwage jobs like data entry cannot have them of course if the companies can pay below minimum wage they will
688,3,641464c47fb7ec8bdcc3f934,no concerns  americans purchase goods made from cheap overseas labor all the time  i dont see issues with this

693,2,6115ddc1b0981cea63afacce,i am concerned that the people who are making these goods are not compensated fairly for their time just because theyre incarcerated doesnt mean they dont deserve to be paid the way a non incarcerated person would be for a job

701,3,6234fb9dc715e1b3a9007c7e,i guess my only real concern would be whether or not the quality of the product or work was up to par  in other words inmates might not have the best work ethic or quality control  then again maybe this concern is unfounded  
702,3,61506367db75b2669d9d2d72,my only concern would be whether the productservice is of high quality and what type of recourse if any could someone pursue if they needed a refund or resolution of a given issue

705,3,615deda1b7f4112d93335556,my only concern is that the corporation selling the products is taking advantage of the prisoner and not paying them very much money while they inturn make a larger profit

715,1,65835b4f5c14a257e1e1f4a1,it is a disgusting practice that seems not far off from modern day slavery  i do not support it and would not buy products that use the labor of prisoners  
716,1,5c660497076e4e0001290b6c,its slavery by another name i would have not problem with prison labor if it was paid equally with wages outside of prisons but it never is its exploiting a prison population and then feeding a system that relies on recidivism
717,2,6310d1ed7f4d3049ba540f3c,even though the manufacture of nearly all goods is exploitative in some way this feel even less ethical i would feel guilty purchasing something that allows a company to make an even bigger profit off of someone who isnt being paid a fair wage for their time and effort 
718,3,5ef78f819d93424af2af742b,wow i had no idea i mean it wouldnt bug me if the items were also of good quality i mean i think of this being a way they can pay their debt to society and doing more good in the world than they initially brought to it so ultimately i say my concerns would be minimal but i would say when they got out and they paid their debt i say they should have the chance to work for a full wage when let out of prison

744,2,610840262cce4d0594be48d0,my only concern is that the materials used are very very cheap my husband is a corrections officer at the prison and the uniforms are made by inmates and the quality is horrible but i suppose thats to be expected
745,2,5f627ea43a49581b4438a944,i think it is bad because they dont get paid a fair wage they should get minimum wage with most of it going towards the cost of housing and food at the prison the rest they shouid be able to keep

757,3,53987712fdf99b68e3a45021,i suppose they could be of inferior quality due to the inmates having less motivation or incentive for example earnings to do a good job that said i can also see them still being good quality because the inmates may find the work somehow rewardingor at least stimulatingengagingso i wouldnt say its a particularly major concern just a possibility
758,3,63c34086cb929e7c9b844a67,i dont like the idea of purchasing products from a prison labor program prisoners make next to no money per hour and even if they did something wrong i dont like support people being taken advantage of if they were paid a fair wage i would feel differently and not be concerned about supporting prison labor

764,2,5f710cf8423f15749e53499b,i would have concerns because workers in prison are paid a fraction of what they would make for similar work outside of prison the incarceration is the punishment for the crime there shouldnt be additional penalty in the form of low wages there should be opportunity for rehabilitation 
765,1,630bbdba33a8711f454d81d9,i am completely against purchasing consumer products made through a prison labor program in addition to exploiting the prisoners these programs undermine wages and benefits for workers outside the prison the states and companies engaging in such practices are effectively recreating the chain gang of the jim crow era convict labor must end
766,1,637e447c16e05f6828930612,i would be concerned that the prisoners would not care as much about the job being done in an accurate manner for example it they were assembling electronics they might feel that they would not face any concequences such as loss of a job if they did do a good job putting the electronics together i also feel that the prisoners might be taken advantage of by the hiring company and be paid a very low amount for the work they do

780,3,5d815ba661013f00170a8def,it concerns me because the prison workers do not receive fair compensation for their work private companies take advantage of the prison workers prisoners deserve fair compensation for their work
781,3,5c2414b8101408000140617a,for me the type of product manufactured by inmates in this program would have a significant impact on my decision if it was a product that i normally use and i deem it to be of equal quality then i purchase it 
782,1,60906c79f8cfd718d6dcb3df,my concern is that those products are being made through and unetheical and immoral way it is essentially forced labor to me since the prisoners are being paid a fraction of what they should be and then big corporations profit from that overall i just wouldnt feel comfortable purchasing something that was made through those means
783,3,5a9353586219a30001d2f2af,i have no problem with it
784,2,5c4d5328889752000156a11d,one concern is that the price has likely been artificially lowered by the abysmal wages paid to the labor component of production costs buying the item creates ongoing demand for further such exploitative labor so yeah i think buying such products is probably a bad idea im not saying people in prison should receive marketrate wages which creates perverse incentives and costs too much taxpayer  money but i do think they should receive decent wages wages that arent actively punitive and humiliating 
785,3,653f07a14204d793e710611e,my concerns go as far as labor laws and safety practices taken to protect the workers who are producing these items for the general public prisoners or not these men and women are working to produce for these contractors or companies theses men and women behind bars are working to not only serve their time incarnated but also being paid a fraction of the cost to produce these general goods that are being sold to the public on top of all that safety practices in the workplace is of high importance ensuring theyre safety should not be any less then a free man or women  
786,2,5e48122927eb23000af799c7,there was no information given regarding compensation for the prisoners so i cant tell if theyre being helped or exploited
787,1,5afda31b7d6f3a0001974e48,i would not purchase these products because i feel like they are exploiting the prisoners to save money i also feel like these prisoners probably are not qualified to make these products and i would worry about the quality of them

790,3,63f7cf04c7b1a4c4972e9254,"one of my primary concerns associated with products manufactured through prison labor is the issue of exploitation and unfair wages prisoners receive extremely low wages for their work and i believe that this practice takes advantage of vulnerable individuals who may have limited agency in determining their working conditions
another concern revolves around the lack of workers rights for individuals engaged in prison labor unlike workers outside the prison system prisoners may not enjoy the same labor rights and protections this discrepancy in rights includes the inability to negotiate wages working hours or ensure safe working conditions
moreover i believe the use of prison labor creates a potential incentive for incarceration if companies benefit from lowcost prison labor there may be a risk of lobbying for policies that contribute to higher incarceration rates further perpetuating a cycle of exploitation
the impact on employment outside prisons is another area of concern companies may opt for cheap prison labor instead of employing individuals from the general workforce potentially contributing to job displacement for nonincarcerated workers
finally the primary purpose of incarceration should be rehabilitation however the use of prison labor for economic gain may raise questions about whether the focus on profits takes precedence over the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals into society
"
791,1,6296295f57c07906c9052955,my biggest concerns would be unfairly abusing labor laws i think its wrong to be making pennies on the dollar yet the corporation can still sell it for massive amounts of profits there should be some sort of equity there between those two practices
792,2,64011bc00dadc55a36ef4939,im concerned about supporting peonage and the school to prison pipeline i dont approve of forprofit prison and think we need a major overhaul of our education healthcare and prison systems how we care for the most vulnerable among us really shows who we are
