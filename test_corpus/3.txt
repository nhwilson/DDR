That’s his apartment, the size of which he dramatically exaggerated, plus a bunch of stuff of relatively minor value (compared to the notional value of the building) which probably anchors the service contract for the building but which is also probably next to impossible to untangle from the building. What I do remember is that Trump actually owns very few of his buildings. His basic model is that he goes to a city, lines up money to build the building (not infrequently from some utter shade-meister, especially when it’s overseas), essentially licenses his name to operation, builds it and then gets what amounts to an ongoing residual in the form of some kind of servicing contract tied to the structure. You sell the units to a mix of people who are wowed by the Trump name and others from Russia and Saudi who want to park their money through a blind LLC. And basically everyone’s happy. But a lot of the flashy stuff can’t be seized because it’s not his.
